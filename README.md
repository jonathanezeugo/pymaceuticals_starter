# pymaceuticals_starter
My_HW_5

This homework was based on processing mice metadata and study results in a combined datafile in order to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin versus the other treatment regimens. Both data files were merged into a single dataframe for the analysis. The data was processed to obtain a clean dataframe for the analysis. A technical report is presented in the introduction in the jupyter notebook and tables, bar plots, pie plots, scatter plots and charts were created to provide the context for the analysis and techical reports. The data results obtained show that Capomulin tops the chart for efficacy and is on track for providing the solution that is sought.
